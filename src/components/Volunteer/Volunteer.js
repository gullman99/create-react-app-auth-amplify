                        There are countless reasons why an extraordinary person would find self-fulfilment in the angelic responsibilities of a St. Lorraineâ€™s volunteer. Many of our caretakers and personal trainers found their inspirations through years of memorable volunteer experiences. At St. Lorraines, volunteers can gain experience and knowledge as a homecare provider or personal fitness trainer that works with a wide range of ages and disabilities. Those who are interested in the medical field, whether it is nursing or therapy, will develop a unique skill set caring for seniors and learning  with the plethora of disabilities and mental health situations in our volunteer programs.
